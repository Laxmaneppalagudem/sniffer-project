Sniffer Project:
The sniff.py code is a basic python3 program that makes use of socket and struct libraries to function as a packet sniffer.
The current implementation only decodes IPv4 data and also shows HTTP data, if found.

Note: This implementation was only tested for Linux. It will not work on Windows OS.

To run:
$python3 ./sniff.py
